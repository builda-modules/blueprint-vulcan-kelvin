# Builda blueprint - Vulcan Kelvin

This is a blueprint to generate a react typescript component with a storybook story in MDX format. It uses SCSS modules for styling.

## Notes

This is the 'Kelvin' edition of the Vulcan blueprint. This means that the `Meta`, `Title`, `Description`, `Canvas`, `Story` or `ArgsTable` blocks are important explicitly for every component you generate.

It is recommended to use the [`Vulcan`](https://github.com/builda-modules/blueprint-vulcan) blueprint which does not include these imports - but which will require some configuration of storybook.
